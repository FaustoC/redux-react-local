- props in ident/initial have to pull defaultProps etc from the wrapped component
- saga combinators
- angular et al
- how is a saga affected when props change?
- shouldComponentUpdate
- optional idents?
- move away from connect, directly subscribe
- hot loading
- deal with props.setState in componentWillMount
