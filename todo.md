- persist tests
- formalize local.mount/.unmount/.swap
- props in ident/initial have to pull defaultProps etc from the wrapped component
- saga combinators
- a better way to integrate with existing redux apps
- angular et al
- delete local state key when !persist
- how is a saga affected when props change?
